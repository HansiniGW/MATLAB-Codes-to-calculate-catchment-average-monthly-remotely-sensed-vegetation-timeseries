# MATLAB-Codes-to-calculate-catchment-average-monthly-remotely-sensed-vegetation-timeseries
This repository contains all the MATLAB codes used to calculate monthly remotely sensed (RS) vegetation timeseries over 155 catchments in Victoria, Australia. The catchment average monthly remotely sensed vegetation timeseries data are publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7527565 .
The input folder in this repository contains a csv file with the IDs of study catchments (i.e. Study_Catchments.csv) and RS vegetation grids intersected catchment area details for each vegetation product

# MATLAB-Codes-to-calculate-catchment-average-monthly-remotely-sensed-vegetation-timeseries
This repository contains all the MATLAB codes used to calculate monthly remotely sensed (RS) vegetation timeseries over 155 catchments in Victoria, Australia. The catchment average monthly remotely sensed vegetation indices (VI) timeseries data are publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7527565 .
The 'inputs' folder in this repository contains a csv file (i.e. Study_Catchments.csv) containing IDs for the study catchments and RS VI's grid intersection details by study catchments that used for the calculation of area weighted catchment average VI's for each vegetation product.
